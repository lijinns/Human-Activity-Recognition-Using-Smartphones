The data set of 'Human Activity Recognition using Smartphones' task is freely available on the web. Download the dataset.

The functions.py file contains the necessary functions to select the best model.

Use main.py to select the best model.

Alternatively, main_parallel.py will help in the faster parallel selection. Syntax for using the file is 'python main_parallel.py --model <model_name> --features <no_of_features>.

The results.py file can be used to predict the labels on test data.

The code.ipynb file has the jupyter notebook implementation of the same.
